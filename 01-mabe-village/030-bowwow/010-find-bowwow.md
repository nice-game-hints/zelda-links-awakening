title: How to find BowWow?
---

It was the M-M-Moblins!

# Show hint 1
Moblins live in the Mysterious Forest. But you should check the phone booth north of Mysterious Forest.

# Show hint 2
Ulrira says that some moblins live in the caves of Tal Tal Heights.

# Tell where are Tal Tal Heights
Tal Tal Heights are east of the Goponga Swamp.

# How to get there?
You can't go through the swamp. You have to go north from Koholint Prairie. Jump over the holes.

# How to deal with the cave?
Just kill all the monsters to get pass through. The boss will throw javelins at you, dodge them. When he rushes to the wall hit him multiple times.
