![Small key location](04_key_location.jpeg)

# Show hint 1
The masked mimics are the *key* here. They move mirrored to your movement.

# Show hint 2
You should kill them.

# Show hint 3
Position Link so that he is back-to-back with a mimic. Then perform a spin attack (long press B) that will hit a mimic to its back.

After you kill both of them the key drops to the other side. You have to go back to get it.
