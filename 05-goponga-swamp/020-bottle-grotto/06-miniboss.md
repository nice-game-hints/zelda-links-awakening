title: "Mini-boss: Hinox"
---

The Hinox mini boss will only have two attacks. It either grabs Link and tosses him or throws a bomb.

# Show hint 1
Every time Hinox misses he is vulnerable to attacks.

# Show hint 2
You just have to lure him to catch you and dodge at the right time. Try using jumping. Wait for him in the non-breaking floors. After dodge immediately hit him one time. He takes three to four hits.
